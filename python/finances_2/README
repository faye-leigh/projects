Finance Manager Program

This program is designed to help users manage their finances. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete transactions. The program also provides a summary of the user's transactions, including the total income, total expenses, and net income.

The program is written in Python and uses a SQLite database to store the user's transactions. The program uses the `sqlite3` module to interact with the database.
